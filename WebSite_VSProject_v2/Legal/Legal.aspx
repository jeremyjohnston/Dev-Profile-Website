        Copyright can be a confusing territory for many people. In many cases the natural confusion over the sometimes varied circumstances surrounding copyright will lead people to rely upon rumor or myth more often than the actual legal facts which naturally confuses the matter even more.

        What is Copyright Infringement?

        To simplify this question, copyright infringement occurs when you do certain things with a creative work which someone else produced without first getting the proper permission.

    <p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
        Some examples of copyright infringement (this is only a partial listing) can include:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left:75px;">
        <li>Placing a photograph or creative work online without proper permission.</li>
        <li>Using a creative work commercially.</li>
        <li>Adapting a creative work of one medium to another, such as making a book into a movie or a photograph into a painting.</li>
        <li>Modifying or editing a creative work without proper permission.</li>
    </ul>

        How Can I Avoid Infringing on Someone's Copyright?<br />

        The best way to avoid infringing on the rights of another creative person is to use your skill, talent and imagination to create your own completely original work. When we use the word 'original' we don't mean that you must come up with an idea which hasn't been used before, when used in copyright matters "original" means that you created your work without referencing or deliberately copying anyone else's work during the process.
        Ensure that all parts of your work, both visual and audio, are your own original creations. If you have used materials which are owned by other people or companies make certain that you have obtained proper permission or licensing for the use before you place your work online.

        In most cases it does not matter how much of the material you have used. Whether it's a few lines of code, a single frame, a few moments of audio, a short clip of video or any other sampling it's still considered to be copyrighted and you still require the owner's permission for use.
        It doesn't matter how you obtained the material, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.
        It doesn't matter whether or not you've credited the proper owner, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.
        It doesn't matter if you are not selling it or making a profit, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.
        It doesn't matter if you can find other people using things without permission, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.
        It doesn't matter if you've edited it a little bit or made a few alterations, if it's recognizable it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.
